            <strong>What is a fund?</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="">
            A fund is an investment that pools together the money from many
            individuals. Fund managers then use it to invest in a wide range of
            <br />
            crypto assets. Each investor is issued units, which represent a
            portion of the holdings of the fund.

            <strong>
              What is the difference between accumulation and income fund?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p className="">
            The type of unit you hold determines how any income generated from
            the fund's underlying investments is treated.
            <br />
            With income units, income is paid out to fund holders as cash. This
            could provide the investor with an income stream or the cash could
            be
            <br />
            reinvested to buy additional units. With accumulation units income
            is retained within the fund and reinvested, increasing the price of
            the units.
            <br />
            Generally, for investors who wish to reinvest income, accumulation
            units offer a more convenient and cost-effective way of doing so.

            <strong>How can I buy funds?</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            You can buy funds online. Please ensure you have read the fund's Key
            Investor Information Document (KIID) or Key Features first which is
            <br />

            <strong>Why invest in funds?</strong>

            <strong>What is the difference between fund and portfolio?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of a portfolio as your personal vault full of all your
            investments. Some of these investments could be funds, which are
            <br />
            like multipacks of various cryptocurrencies, DeFi instruments and
            other type of investments
            <br />
            Funds are managed by a professional fund manager and, when you buy a
            fund, you're actually buying "units" of it, with the
            <br />
            fund manager using your money to invest in crypto assets.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What is DeFi?</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="">
            DeFi is a class of financial products that are offered through
            blockchains.
            <br />
            “DeFi” stands for “decentralized finance” and got its name because
            blockchains are decentralized databases that record transactions and
            aren’t
            <br />
            controlled or managed by any central authority.
            <br />
            By design, DeFi products opera without brokers and intermediaries,
            which are instead what makes traditional finance possible. Without
            brokers
            <br />
            accessible. and intermediaries, charging fees at every turn;
            financial transactions become faster, more affordable, more
            transparent, and best of all more
            <br />
            All these advantages made DeFi companies and DeFi financial
            instruments very attractive for users and also for investors.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Why investing in cryptocurrencies and DeFi is more complicated
              than traditional assets like stocks and bonds?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            By design, blockchains instruments do not use financial
            intermediaries who in traditional finance demand a fee for helping
            you buying or selling products,
            <br />
            and keeping them safe for you while you invest.
            <br />
            For that, the entire investment process is left to you. This makes
            investing cheaper and more transparent but also less immediate.
            <br />
            On top of that, blockchain instruments and crypto assets are created
            by crypto protocols; they cannot be simply bought and sold like
            normal investments
            <br />
            and require technical knowledge that is often beyond
            non-professional crypto investors.
            <br />
            Invest with Moolah funds to simplify your investing in crypto.

              What is the difference between financial assets and instruments?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Oversimplifying, they can be used as synonyms. More correctly,
            financial instruments generate financial assets. For that, their
            meaning overlaps.{" "}

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Financial assets refer to assets that arise from contractual
                agreements on future cash flows or from owing equity instruments
                of another entity.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Financial instruments refer to a contract that generates a
                financial asset to one of the parties involved, and an equity
                instrument or financial liability to
                <br />
                the other entity.

            <strong>What is diversification and why is important?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ever heard the saying, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"?
            That's what diversification is all about! It's a smart way to spread
            your investments across
            <br />
            the market and around the world, so you're not relying on just one
            region, industry or asset type. This can help boost your potential
            returns without <br />
            adding extra risk.{" "}

          <h4>Understanding Moolah funds</h4>

          <p className="">
            <strong>What is a Moolah fund?</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Moolah funds are a typical sub-category of funds.
            <br />
            As traditional funds, Moolah funds pool together the money from many
            individuals.
            <br />
            While traditional funds are 100% invested by fund managers who look
            after the fund in exchange for a compensation, Moolah funds invest
            by
            <br />
            indexes and automated strategies.
            <br />
            This makes Moolah funds cheaper and more transparent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What is index investing?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            An index measures the combined performance of a collection of
            assets. For example, the 100 largest companies by market
            capitalisation.
            <br />
            An index fund will typically buy assets, and try to maintain this,
            in every company listed on the index it’s tracking.
            <br />
            In simpler words, index investing consists of buys shares of a fund
            that replicates a targeted market index.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What indexes are Moolah funds tracking?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Moolah funds track the Moolah indexes.
            <br />
            Moolah indexes summarize crypto market segments, themes and other
            sub-categories.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why investing in Moolah funds?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Don't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack!”
            (John C. Bogle, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only
            <br />
            Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns).
            <br />
            You can’t invest directly in an index, but you can invest in an
            index fund, so in a fund that replicates that index.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Can you trade Moolah funds like normal ETFs?</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="">
            At this stage, Moolah funds will not be listed on an exchange, they
            can be traded throughout the day like other crypto assets.
            <br />
            ETFs can encourage short-term trading, with investors moving from
            one strategy to another rather than fostering a buy-and-hold
            mentality.
            <br />
            Frequent trading can be detrimental to an investor’s returns over a
            long-term horizon.
            <br />
            Moolah funds could be traded like normal ETFs in the future.

                If you want to grow your wealth for a medium/long term future -
                like a pension, a sum to use for an important purchase - an
                accumulation type
                <br />
                fund would work better for you.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you need a monthly income, then an income fund is the best

            <strong>Can I add more than one fund to my portfolio?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes you can invest in how many funds you wish. Adding more funds
            will increase the diversification of your portfolio. You could also
            mix and match investment

          <h4>Investment costs</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>How much will I have to pay as fees for my funds?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer our funds at a very competitive fees: 0.25% for fund
            custody and 2% for fund management.
            <br />
            No hidden fees otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How do I pay transaction costs?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Funds aim to ensure that trading costs are spread fairly between the
            different investors in a fund - existing investors, new investors
            putting money in, and departing
            <br />
            investors taking money out.
            <br />
            In particular, they aim to protect existing investors from the costs
            of any trading which is caused by new investors and departing
            investors.
            <br />
            They have two different ways of doing this. Some funds retain the
            right to apply a “dilution levy” and others a and others a
            “bid/offer spread”
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A dilution levy is an explicit allocation of the fund's
                  trading costs to the new investments. For example, if a new
                  investment of £10,000 created £20 of
                  <br />
                  trading costs for the fund, this £20 could be passed on
                  explicitly to the new investors as a dilution levy.{" "}
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A "bid/offer spread" means that new investments pay a higher
                  price for units, which indirectly contributes to the fund's
                  trading costs. For example, if

            These work in different ways, but they both result in the value of
            units purchased being less than the amount invested. Which is why it
            is usually not sensible to
            <br />
            switch investments too frequently.

            <strong>What is the dilution levy?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A dilution levy is an allocation of a fund's trading costs to the
            investments which have created those costs. It is used to protect
            the majority of investors from
            <br />
            the costs of trading by a minority.
            <br />
            Without a dilution levy, these trading costs would be paid by the
            fund, which would disadvantage existing investors (as they are
            effectively paying someone else's
            <br />
            trading costs).
            <br />
            It is not paid to any third party but goes directly into the fund to
            be shared across all investors.
            <br />
            For example, if a new investment of £10,000 created £20 of trading
            costs for the fund, this £20 could be passed on explicitly as a
            dilution levy, meaning the total
            <br />
            invested would be £9,980. The £20 dilution levy would then be paid
            into the fund, compensating it for the trading costs.
            <br />
            Not all funds apply dilution levies and funds often make no
            adjustment on the basis that investors' overall trading costs are
            generally similar,
            <br />
            everyone is fair overall.
            <br />
            The amount also varies depending depends on the type of assets the
            fund invests in. For example, it will usually be higher for funds
            that invest in assets
            <br />
            that are harder (and hence more expensive) to trade, such as small
            companies or property.
            <br />
            When funds do apply a dilution levy it is typically between 0% and
            2% of the transaction.

            <strong>What is the bid/offer spread?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A bid/offer spread means that new investments pay a slightly higher
            price for units. This indirectly contributes to the trading costs
            incurred by the fund when
            <br />
            investing the new money. It is used to protect the majority of
            investors from the costs of trading by a minority.
            <br />
            Without a bid/offer spread, these trading costs would be paid by the
            fund, which would disadvantage existing investors (as they are
            effectively paying someone
            <br />
            else's trading costs).
            <br />
            For example, if a new investment of £10,000 created £20 of trading
            costs for the fund, the unit price might be set 0.2% higher, meaning
            the value of units
            <br />
            purchased was only £9,980 (with the remaining £20 used by the fund
            to cover its cost).
            <br />
            Not all funds apply bid/offer spreads and some funds often make no
            adjustment on the basis that investors' overall trading costs are
            generally similar, so sharing them between everyone is fair overall.
            <br />
            The amount also varies depending on the type of assets the fund
            invests in. For example, it will usually be higher for funds that
            invest in assets that are harder (and hence more expensive) to
            trade,
            <br />
            such as small companies or property.
            <br />
            When funds do apply a bid/offer spread it is typically between 0%
            and 2% of the unit price, but can occasionally be higher.

            <strong>
              What is the difference between funds and accounts costs?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Costs matter because every pound you pay in costs eats into your
            future returns. What's more, just like returns, the impact of costs
            compounds over time.
            <br />
            Investing charges might not sound like big numbers. But if you're
            getting a return of 4% and paying 2% in charges, that's half of your
            returns gone.
            <br />
            When you invest you normally pay 2 broad types of charges: fund and
            account-level.
            <br />
            Fund costs are designed to cover the cost of running the fund
            <br />
            They vary by fund – the ongoing charges figure (OCFs) range is
            capped to 2%.
            <br />
            For a $10,000 investment would come to just $200 a year based on our
            fund-range average.
            <br />
            Account costs are designed to cover the cost of running our service,
            the associated technology and our communications.
            <br />
            Account costs start at £5 a month, capped at $500.
            <br />
            For a $10,000 investment would be just $20 each year.
